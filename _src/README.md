##What You Will Learn:
*	Get a run through of the basic JavaScript language constructs
*	Get familiar with the Functions and Closures of JavaScript
*	Code using the powerful object-oriented feature in JavaScript
*	Master DOM manipulation, cross-browser strategies, and ES6
*	Understand the basic concurrency constructs in Javascript and best performance strategies
*	Harness the power of patterns for tasks ranging from application building to code testing
*	Build large-scale apps seamlessly with the help of reactive patterns
*	Get to grips with creational, behavioral, and structural design patterns
*	Explore advanced design patterns including dependency injection
*	Develop more powerful applications with currying and function composition
*	Simplify code with method chains of pure, higher-order functions
*	Separate core logic from the program state to write more maintainable code
*	Create more reliable code with closures and immutable data

##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

You will see code something similar to the following:

```
  function add(a,b){
    return a+b;
  }
  c = add(1,2);
  console.log(c);  //prints 3
 
```
